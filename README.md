		Welcome to the Deemos HLL server!
This server is Warfare only, meaning it has no offensive maps.
The server is part of the Deemos constitution, which can be found on:
			 https://deemos.club/


				Player issues?
			Report it to an admin via:
				!admin <problem>


            Squad Lead/Commander Rules
1. SL/Commander should have the intention to lead (a squad), and have a working microphone.
2. SL with open squads should be above level 20. To play Commander, you should be above level 50.

				Rules
2. Locked solo-tank and solo-recon squads are not allowed.
 - If you are waiting for a friend, then this is fine.
3. You are to be removed from the server if you obstruct the team in any way.

4. If you're asked by an admin to help balance the server, you are to listen to the admin.
5. Any abuse of the in-game vote kick system will be punished.

				Teamkilling
Intentional team killing is forbidden on our server. If you are teamkilled you are requested to call an admin,
and to not take matters into your own hands.
If a team kill happens accidentally it is to be forgiven, and a small sorry in the chat is the only thing we
request from you.

---------------------- SEEDING RULES ----------------------
Seeding is when the server is getting filled up from zero players and lasts until there are 25 players in each of the opposing factions.

1. Fight only over the centre point and concentrace fights only in the middle sector row/column of the map.
2. You are to not aim to destroy enemy garrisons that are in initially owned sectors.
3. Only garrisons in the middle objectives row/column can be actively hunted.
4. AFK or unassigned seeding is allowed.

Seeding the server will be extremely helpful and you will be thanked for the process.
